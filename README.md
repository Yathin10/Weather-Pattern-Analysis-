📊 Project 1: Climate Trend Exploration and Comparative Study

This project focuses on analyzing global weather data to uncover meaningful trends and patterns over time. The primary objective is to study how climate indicators have changed globally and then narrow the analysis down to a specific city. By comparing the city’s temperature trends against global averages, the project highlights localized climate behavior in contrast to broader global shifts.
The analysis provides insight into long-term climate dynamics, anomalies, and potential urban effects on weather. This comparative approach enables a better understanding of both macro (global) and micro (city-level) weather patterns, which is critical for climate research, urban planning, and environmental studies.
